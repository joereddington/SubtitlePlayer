A fork of iandevlin.github.io designed to be used to display *only* subtitles, without the film. 

Next steps are to write proper import methods for files and make sure that syncing is a little easier. We also need several different lengths of movies (or the ability to loop). Would be nice to have a open source full length demo for something like a play... that would be cool (Shakespeare in another language perhaps).
