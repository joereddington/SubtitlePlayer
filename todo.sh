#So what do we have to do? 

#First thing is that we download the files that are there. 
#
#
#Then we convert them into files that can be played by our player. 
#
#
#Then we have a way of displaying them. 
#---Firstly by just letting the user select all the subtitles for one video
#---Then by having a set of links to videos
#---For each downloaded file we also want a html file, insterting the correct filenames in.  It's going to be a php file eventually, but this will be quick enought
